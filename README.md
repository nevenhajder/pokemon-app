This is a small project that calls the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) to get information about Pokemon that a user searches for. It uses ~~[axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)~~ the `fetch` API to make the requests and uses [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for layout and styles. It was created using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

I did this just to get some practice. And again in TS to get some more practice.
